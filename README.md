This project uses OpenTK and modern OpenGL to open an 800x600 window and render a simple salmon color rectangle. It works by defining four vertices (rectangle corners) and six indices (two triangles), uploading them to the GPU using a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) and an Element Buffer Object (EBO), and configuring a Vertex Array Object (VAO) to describe the vertex layout. A minimal vertex shader passes the positions through to the pipeline, while a fragment shader fills the rectangle with color. The render loop clears the screen, draws the rectangle each frame, and swaps buffers, with the window closing when the Esc key is pressed.
